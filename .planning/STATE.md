## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- shadcn/ui + custom theme as component foundation (Radix accessibility primitives + Tailwind styling)
- Friendly and empowering design tone — families in crisis need encouragement, not clinical interfaces
- Visual-only refresh — no feature changes, no backend changes, no content rewrites
- Motion library for animations alongside CSS transitions
- Custom typography required — no Inter/Arial/generic system fonts

### Pending Todos

None.
