    'If you also qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), you may automatically qualify for Medicaid. Medicaid can also work alongside waiver programs to cover more services for people with disabilities.',
  insuranceCoordination:
    'If your family member has private insurance AND qualifies for Medicaid, both can work together. Your private insurance pays first (it is the "primary" plan). Then Medicaid helps cover what is left over — like copays, deductibles, or services private insurance does not cover. This is called "coordination of benefits." You do not have to choose one or the other. Having both means less out-of-pocket cost for your family.',
